                 <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.<br />
                 Hyper Text means text with links in it.<br /> 
                 Markup Language means a language used to make text do more than sit on a page.<br />
                 For example it can turn into an image,links, tables,lists,and much more.<br />
                 HTML is mainly used to create web pages.</p>
                <p>CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS can be described as the<br />
            skin and make up that cover the bones of HTML.<br />
            In other words CSS makes web pages look pretty.</p>
